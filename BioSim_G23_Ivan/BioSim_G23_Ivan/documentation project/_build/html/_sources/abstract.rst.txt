Abstract
========================================

Ecosystems on Earth have defined the fauna and the flow of life for millions of years,
balancing the flow of life on our planet. Only with the arrival of homo sapiens, the wise
men, has this balance been disturbed and altered. However, this project is about a classic
ecosystem on the island Rossumøya, where the grass-eating herbivore population is balanced
out by the meat-eating carnivores. The purpose of this project was to simulate the
population dynamics on Rossumøya, observe the changes in the population and see if this
a stable population of both species could be achieved.

Rossumøya is not an actual island, but rather just a theoretical one. The geography of
the island is a variable, chosen by those running the simulation and many properties of
both of the species are also changeable. The simulation project was written in python 3.7
programming language with the help of PyCharm build 2019.2.3.
