The project was a big challenge, but a fun one. Although a full visualisation of the simulation has not been finished and a final product has not been achieved, the code written could be improved on at a later time, as a home project.

The task taught the student new skills within programming and has helped answer previously unaswered questions. The fact that the structure of the code was not pre-determined and had to be worked on by the student has shown a different side of programming and allowed for personal development. Finally has the math from previous math courses become useful, which is great. As Yngve has stated, there is a difference between those taking the INF200 course and those just taking programming courses without doing advanced math prior to it. With more effort and at a later time, more programming projects with advanced mathematics can be developed with the things learned in the course.

GitKraken working together with PyCharm works great as well, with PyCharm checking for possible mistakes and PEP8 guidelines and with GitKraken allowing you to see the changes you have done to your project, making it possible to roll back changes and go to a previous version if needed. The assisstance of these two programs has made structuring the project and fixing bugs a much easier task.
