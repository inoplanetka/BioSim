Introduction
========================================

The enviromental agency of Pylandia has given out a task to develop a program for the
simulation of population dynamics on the island Rossumøya. An expert is expected to develop
a population dynamics simulation by the end of January 2020.

Rossumøya is populated by two species, herbivores and carnivores. These are different in
many ways, with one being a plant eater and the other one a meat eater, as the names suggest.
The island has several different landscape types with different kinds of characteristics,
with the animals living in these. As expected with an island, it is surrounded by water,
which animals can not live in or migrate to.

The main concerns going into the project were about the structure of the simulation. Since it
is the group's first time doing a project of this scale, a well working plan needs to be established
before writing any code. This is to have well structured, working and bug free code that could be
understood even by those uninitiated in the project. Therefore, well chosen function and variable
names are crucial, as well as writing code following PEP8 python coding guidelines.

The main questions that are to be answered in the project:

• Could a working island population dynamics program be created for Rossumøya?
• Could a stable population of both species on the island be achieved after an amount of years?
